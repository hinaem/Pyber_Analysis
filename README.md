# Pyber_Analysis
1. Overview of the analysis:

    After completing my Certification from Rutger’s University in Data Visualisation, I have accomplished a successful career at Pyber. Pyber is a ride-sharing app company. It is very similar to Uber and Lyft but way cooler. Being that I am new to the company, I am going to work with Python’s scripts using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib to clean the current data they in their CSV files to get a better sense of what we are currently doing and what we should be doing to improve access to the service we provide and how we can make it more affordable for the three major cities types we service; rural, suburb and urban. 

2. Results:
  
    Based on my analysis in the first deliverable the below is the differences I have found in ride-sharing data: 
    * The total rides, based on the outcomes, I can declare that Pyber is mostly used in Urban cities and in the Rural cities its not very common. 
    * The total drivers and total fares, based on the outcomes, its very similar that due to not having much rides in rural cities, we have the least amount of drivers there and the majority of our drivers are in the Urban and Suburban Cities. Due to the amount of rides we have in thoes cities it effects the total fares.
    * Average fare per ride and driver, based on these two colums in the table, even though there are less rides in Rural cities, our drivers are making an average of $55.48 in the Rural area. Compared to Urban cities where theres much more production and usage of Pyber our drivers are averaging $16.57. This also makes sense because in Rural cities, rides are usually more longer in distance due to the city vs Urban where the distances can vary but not be as much longer. 
    * Total fare by city type, due to very low usage of Pyber rides in the Rural cities compared to Urban there is a difference of at least 35,000 + rides. 

3. Summary:
    In conculusion of my analysis, I would like to add these recommendations to the CEO to address the differences I found among the city types. 
     Due to not many rides in the rural areas, I believe we can increase the amount a bit to still have it be worth it to our driver and since there isnt many rides already in that area, the passenger requesting the ride won't really mind paying. As we can see the average amount of fare per ride in that area is $34.60. 
     In order to increase rides in Rural and Suburban areas with increasing the price, we can do some promotions also for thoes areas for example "After your first ten rides you can get a ten percent discount for your next five rides" something like this. Based on the line graph for our Rural cities we can have the promotion week before the month ends and week of beginning of the month, the reason I say this is because that is where the line is going up and since people are taking Pyber then adding a promotion will promote more. This will increase rides and profit.
